+ Created pleminary Application structure

v1.1 27.03.2014
Customer Feedback on pleminary sketches

: For page 1.1.3, student should see all of the question, 
where for each right and actual answer is shown

: For the whole application instead of managing what quiz is open according to date,
instead simple switch UI element should be implemented for teacher dashboard. So
that way only one quiz can be in position open, all others should be closed.

: For ease of grading processes, page should be added where displayed list of students
and the whole result history for the student, like 
[studentNumber | quiz1 result | quiz2 result | quiz3 result | Average]
[a1234567 | 75 | 85 | 80 | 80]
