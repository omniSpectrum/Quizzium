CASE DESCRIPTION
==============================

Jukka asked for quiz platform, easy and simple, which
would be based on jsp and servlets. It is not require to
use Maven however in his opinion it would ease work with
database. For questions displayed to students Jukka
would like that they would be displayed in random order
to prevent cheating.

For testing the application Selenium should be used.
The project should be distributed as WAR file  for 
java 6 plus source code plus local MySql database 
with basic set of stored procedures.
